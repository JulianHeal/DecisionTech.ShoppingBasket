I have used the factory method pattern to create the products, and the decorator pattern 
to apply the single responsibility principle. The scenarios outlined in the instructions 
have been implemented as acceptance tests in the tests project. Other than use SOLID 
principles and TDD I have not implemented anything other than what was outlined; the app 
has no UI and can only be run through tests.
